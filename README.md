# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation to do this project was to fully understand the prework so that I am ready for the first day of the bootcamp.
- I built this project so that I would have a centralized and interactive location where I could compile notes as I worked through the prework.
- This project solves the problem of having scattered notes or not taking notes at all.
- I learned how to create a basic webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Each section in the Prework Study Guide contains notes about the languages we have learned so far, specifically HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In the HTML section, we are reminded that when speaking HTML we give our content structure. In the CSS section, we are reminded that when speaking CSS we give our content style. And in the JavaScript section, we are reminded that when speaking JavaScript we give our content interactivity.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
